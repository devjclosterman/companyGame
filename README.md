Jeopardy for techie's


My company does work for Indeed. While doing work at Indeed they have been included in their mandatory social hour, once per week.
So Banyan Labs now wants to inherit this social hour for they company. I am going to create a game for Banyan Labs to play and it is going to be a quiz. 
Not really like Jeopardy the answer is not going to be a question. If you guess the answer you will get a point. The winner gets a prize.

This game and code will be available and published on Banyan Labs github. In case your wondering why it's not here.
